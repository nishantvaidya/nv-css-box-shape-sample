CSS has evolved from using a table  ->  position  -> float property for creating 2 , 3 or multiple columns layout. Now, Layout design became  much similar and easy  with CSS Flexbox, Grid and Shape specification. Moreover,  I'm hugely impressed by shape specification for a easy design of any dimensional shape. I believe this will give more power to web for magazine like page layout so no more rectangular box only in web pages for content.
